Naming:
nodes - capital letters (except for some because of godot breaking when naming nodes)
methods- lowercase letters followed by capital for preceding nouns/adjectives
attributes - same as methods
classes- capital letters
resources/singletons - capital letters except for some because of godot name breaking

Attacking:
Attacking is a bit complicated, most attack logic is being done inside the countdown() function.

The best way it can be implemented is through a fight function in the card, upon executing this fight function inside the card. the opposing card/whatever target the card is atacking takes damage.

Additional effects can be applied throughout effect objects using resources (to be covered later on)

meanwhile in the countdown function, there should be multiple delays based on the objects within the enemy object.

The countdown function can grab a list of targets the card is targetting and then iterate through that target list to study the delays needed for each card as well as activating each card's effect iteratively
