# unnamed necromancy game
 The godot 4 version of the card game I am working on. Base features from the godot 3 version have been re implemented + more. 

 The roadmap(in order of importance):
 - ~~Enemy and hero taking direct damage~~ + game over screen
 - death animations
 - ~~main menu~~
 - basic innate card effects: ~~apply poison on hit~~, ~~apply hex on hit~~, attack up on attack
 - basic buffs and debuffs: ~~sleep~~, ~~poison~~, attack up, ~~hex~~, ~~symbols~~
 - spells
 - other events
 - a "tarot card" map navigation system, where the area you go to is decided by the tarot cards you choose
